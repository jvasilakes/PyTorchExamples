# Model Examples

This repository contains example implementations of basic PyTorch models that, to the best of my knowledge and ability,
embody Python 3 and PyTorch best practices. 

The purpose of these implementations is both to learn these best practices and to provide as a source of code I can copy
and refactor to new projects in order to save time.


## Models

 * [BiLSTM for token classification](https://github.com/jvasilakes/PyTorchExamples/tree/master/token_classification)
 * [LSTM Seq2Seq model for translation](https://github.com/jvasilakes/PyTorchExamples/tree/master/seq2seq)
